# Abstract

Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of $1024 \times 1024$ images for the first time from a score-based generative model.

# Conclusion

We present Palette, a simple, general framework for image-to-image translation. Palette achieves strong results on four challenging image-to-image translation tasks (colorization, inpainting, uncropping, and JPEG restoration), outperforming strong GAN and regression baselines. Unlike many GAN models, Palette produces diverse and high fidelity outputs. This is accomplished without task-specific customization nor optimization instability. We also present a multi-task Palette model, that performs just as well or better over their task-specific counterparts. Further exploration and investigation of multi-task diffusion models is an exciting avenue for future work. This paper shows some of the potential of image-to-image diffusion models, but we look forward to seeing new applications.
